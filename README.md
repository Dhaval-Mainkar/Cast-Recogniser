# Cast-Recogniser
A simple face recognition python-based program that helps to identify actors from a stored video using a face recognition library.

Cast Recogniser can be an awesome program if you keep wondering "wait I have seen him somewhere before" not anymore since you have to just provide as minimum as 1 image of that actor and it will show you his/her's  stage name. With a bunch of images of different actors, it can be really useful for some popular shows with a lot of guest cameos.

# Some shortcomings related to the program
1. This model depends on various factors such as how close is the actor to the camera the more the distance from the camera the less it is to recognize the actor.

2. It also depends on the lights if there is a scene where you have very less lights then it is hard to detect faces.

3. If you want to run this program smoothly you need to run it on a GPU utilized pc because such stored videos give a very high fps loss.
